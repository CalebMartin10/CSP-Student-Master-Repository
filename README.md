The file included in this repository can be run very simply by installing and opening the file on your computer.
The file has a database of all students and their respective grades. The program uses this data to calculate their averages, the top students, the class's overall average, and the amount of students who passed. The top students, class average, and amount of passed students is presented in a clean report for easier teacher reference.
